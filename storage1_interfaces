# This is a single-NIC configuration to implement the required bridges
# for OpenStack-Ansible. This illustrates the configuration of the first
# Infrastructure host and the IP addresses assigned should be adapted
# for implementation on the other hosts.
#
# After implementing this configuration, the host will need to be
# rebooted.
